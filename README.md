This repo contains a simple, illustrative implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network: Long short-term memory (LSTM) model in the context of price prediction. *By no means, this is a serious project given that prices are usually modelled as random walks and it is pointless trying to predict them!* The aim was to rather get myself familiar with the some practical aspects of statistical machine learning models. Indeed, the script was developed during a full-day coding challenge at the end of the course "Statistical Machine Learning" in Rice University, and I upload it as is.

To be more exact, this is an application with many-to-one structure in terms of dimensions of input-to-output. To that end, I will first retrieve the price data of Bitcoin from a remote GitHub repository specifically created for this project; Then, I will pre-process the data in which the data is split into training and test sections, and then, the training data is normalized since the LSTM requires pre-scaled data; Moreover, I will also provide an explanation of other data pre-processing techniques through which I transform the input data used by the model into 3-D arrays; Lastly, I will train the model and present a prediction based on the trained model.
